For security reasons, LightDM does not remember the username by default. 

To make it remember your username by making a simple change in itsâ€™ configuration file.

File /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf has to have 

[SeatDefaults]
greeter-hide-users = false

However I moved this to the bodhi config to aviod modifying Debian packages:

Add to to file: /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/70-linuxbodhi.conf
