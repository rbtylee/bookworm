Can you install debian without a root password

Remove the root password:

sudo passwd -d root

Lock the account:

sudo passwd -l root

SULOGIN(8)  
sulogin is invoked by init when the system goes into single-user
       mode.

       The user is prompted:

       Give root password for system maintenance (or type Control-D for
       normal startup):

       If the root account is locked and --force is specified, no
       password is required.
