grub rescue with no password does not work with passwd locked, only with passwd deleted.
man 8 autologin

Can you install debian without a root password

Remove the root password:

sudo passwd -d root

Lock the account:

sudo passwd -l root

SULOGIN(8)  
sulogin is invoked by init when the system goes into single-user
       mode.

       The user is prompted:

       Give root password for system maintenance (or type Control-D for
       normal startup):

       If the root account is locked and --force is specified, no
       password is required.

man shadow

   If the password field contains some string that is not a valid
   result of crypt(3), for instance ! or *, the user will not be able
   to use a unix password to log in (but the user may log in the
   system by other means).

   This field may be empty, in which case no passwords are required to
   authenticate as the specified login name. However, some
   applications which read the /etc/shadow file may decide not to
   permit any access at all if the password field is empty.

   A password field which starts with a exclamation mark means that
   the password is locked. The remaining characters on the line
   represent the password field before the password was locked.
So * means no password can be used to access the account, and ! means its locked

5.2.3.  The rescue boot option is unusable without a root password
With the implementation of sulogin used since buster, booting with the rescue option always requires the root password. If one has not been set, this makes the rescue mode effectively unusable. However it is still possible to boot using the kernel parameter init=/sbin/sulogin --force

To configure systemd to do the equivalent of this whenever it boots into rescue mode (also known as single mode: see systemd(1)), run sudo systemctl edit rescue.service and create a file saying just:

[Service]
Environment=SYSTEMD_SULOGIN_FORCE=1
      
It might also (or instead) be useful to do this for the emergency.service unit, which is started automatically in the case of certain errors (see systemd.special(7)), or if emergency is added to the kernel command line (e.g. if the system can't be recovered by using the rescue mode).

For background and a discussion on the security implications see #802211.
