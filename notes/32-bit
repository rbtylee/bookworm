when this is made for 32-bit, I suggest do not use chromium as default browser.  It requires SSE3 which is not available on many 32-bit machiens (iincluding mine) so won't even start.  Suggest use firefox-esr or epiphany-browser.

I noticed already it starts with the bodhi quickstart file by default...  without any additional configuration. 
But also by default its set to "restore tabs on startup" so once you start using it, it isnt the home page anymore. 

Another thing with epiphany, every time I open prefererences, have to resize the window manually, it always starts bigger than my screen (which is now 1360x768)
[Tested on debian/gnome, it doesn't do that.] 

It resizes fine and scrollbar works fine.... but for some reason always pops up too big.
And on my actual pentium 4, I have an actual CRT that I use at 1024x768 (or 1280x1024 when something needs 720p).

(and on my athlon64 we use a 1360x768 monitor....  so if i've got two machines using 768 rows, imagine other people might be doing so with their older machines too, so fitting in 768 lines seems useful....)

[Tested on debian/gnome, it doesn't do that.] i mess with its configuration on Bodhi, ( that sets the QS on first opening the app) whatever I am doing clearly needs to be adjusted.
